This folder contain .sh files needed to run the real analysis. The .py files will be automatically implemented by the .sh files. The figures for the real analysis can be generated using the "plot.ipynb".

Before running the analysis. Download the human whole-genome file (.tsz format) for Chromosome 1-22, from https://zenodo.org/records/5512994. 


1. Run "run_all_combine_dif_mu.sh" on shell (e.g. Linux) to produce result in Fig 4 of the paper.
2. Run “run_real_sim.sh” and "run_real_sim_bottleneck.sh" to produce result in Fig 5 of the paper.
3. Run "run_real_check_w.sh" for Figure S8
4. Run "run_real_sim_afri.sh" and "run_real_sim_bottleneck_afri.sh" for Figure S9.
